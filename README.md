Bitbucket Deployer
==================

Simple tool for deployment and update repositories on remote servers using Bitbucket post service.

# How it works?

At first you should put the bitbucket-refresh.php into the path you need to get the repositories, after you need to configure the Bitbucket service to post when you perform actions.

You can set it accessing `https://bitbucket.org/{user_name}/{repository_name}}/admin/services`.
